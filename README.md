# Package hunt
 Internship project 

The class acquaintance diagram is in the root folder of the project, the build is in the Build folder, all the scripts are in the scripts folder in the assets folder.
I made the music and all the assetes (except for the conveyor belt and background) myself.

I did not make the extra bonus goals because i couldnt work on the project for 2 days because my room was not safe to be in due to a possible gasleak that had to be checked out (turned out to be nothing).
